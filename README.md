Clustering with K-Means
This project applies K-Means clustering to the Mall Customers dataset to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior. The dataset was preprocessed by removing non-numerical identifiers, handling missing values, and standardizing features to ensure fair comparison across variables. The clustering process involved fitting a K-Means model, determining the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow Method, and visualizing the results in 2D space via PCA. Cluster quality was assessed using the Silhouette Score to measure separation and cohesion. This project demonstrates customer segmentation using unsupervised learning, dimensionality reduction for visualization, and model evaluation techniques for clustering.
